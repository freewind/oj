OpenJava is an extensible language based on Java(TM). The OpenJava MOP
(Metaobject Protocol) is the extension interface of the language.
Through the MOP, the programmers can customize the language to
implement a new language mechanism.

OpenJava helps people who want to develop better Java libraries, that
is, easy-to-use and efficient ones.  It also helps people who are
developing their own extended Java languages.  OpenJava can be regarded
as a toolkit for constructing a Java preprocessor.


** How to set up OpenJava

This directory contains the OpenJava version 1.0a release in both source
and bytecode form.  You should find the following files and subdirectories
in this release:

   README        This file.
   COPYRIGHT     Copyright notices are described in this text file.
   src/          OpenJava source files in Java-packaged form.
   classes/      OpenJava bytecode files in Java-packaged form.
   htdocs/       OpenJava API in HTML format.
   bin/          Shell scripts useful to use OpenJava system.
   tutorial/     Tutorial files in HTML format containing some examples of
                 meta-programming in the example subfolder.
   docs/         Other notes.


To set up, you must do either 1) or 2)
1) Set CLASSPATH environment variable to include 'classes' directory.
2) Use ojc (for solaris), ojc.sh (for unix), or ojc.exe (for windows
with cygwin) command in bin directory.

Additionally, make sure that your Java compiler is in your PATH as the
name 'javac'.  Otherwise OpenJava compiler fails to generate bytecode.


** How to run

The detailed explanation is shown in the programmer's guide above.
The execution way is similar to :

    $ java openjava.ojc.Main sourcecode.oj

or :

    solaris% bin/ojc.ksh sourcecode.oj
    linux$ bin/ojc.sh sourcecode.oj
    windows> bin/ojc.bat sourcecode.oj

For example, type in the top directory,

    $ java -classpath .:classes openjava.ojc.Main \
	examples/verbose/VerboseClass.oj
    $ java -classpath .:classes openjava.ojc.Main \
	examples/verbose/Hello.oj
